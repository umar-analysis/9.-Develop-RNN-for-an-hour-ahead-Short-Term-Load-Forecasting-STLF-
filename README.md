# 🧪 Lab 9 – Develop RNN for an Hour-Ahead Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF)

This lab focuses on building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for predicting short-term electricity load one hour ahead using time-series data. The model is designed to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in load behavior for improved forecasting accuracy.

### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Time-series data preprocessing and sequence generation
- RNN model design using Keras with `SimpleRNN` layers
- One-hour-ahead forecasting using past 24-hour data
- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE
- Training monitoring and callbacks for optimization
